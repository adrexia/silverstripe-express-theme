/**
 * Layout stylesheet.
 *
 * The rule of thumb is that the styles from here will not be needed for the CMS editor.
 * Styles related to content editing should go into typography.[s]css.
 *
 * *** ATTENTION SCSS DEVELOPER ***
 *
 * If you are working with SCSS, please do not import other top-level stylesheets here such
 * as typography.scss. We want to be able to generate clean CSS for the third-party dev to
 * work with directly, and this will result in code duplication between generated css files!
