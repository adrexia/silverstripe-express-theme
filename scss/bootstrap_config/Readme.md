# Customising Bootstrap

If you need to modify any of the files in the bootstrap module, first copy them into the 'custom' directory, then edit _bootstrap.scss, _responsive.scss, or _typography.scss to point to your version of the file. We have set up a few files in this manner already, including the _variables.scss file as this is the file you are most likely to want to change.
