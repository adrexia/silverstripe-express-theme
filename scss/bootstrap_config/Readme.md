# Customising Bootstrap

If you need to modify any of the files in the bootstrap module, first copy them to this directory, then edit _bootstap.scss, _responsive.scss, or _typography.scss to point to your version of the file. We have set up the _variables.scss file in this way for you, as this is the file you are most likely to need to change.
