# Express Theme
This theme is designed to work with Silverstripe Express, found here:

https://github.com/silverstripe-droptables/silverstripe-installer (branch: ssexpress)

You can choose to work either with the SCSS files, or with the CSS. If you would like to work with the SCSS, you will need to grab the module bootstrap and place it in the root of your theme directory.
